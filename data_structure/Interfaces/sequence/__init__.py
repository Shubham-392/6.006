$$ SquenceInterface $$

--- Sequences maintain a collection of items in an extrinsic order,
    where each item stored has a rank
    in the sequence, including a first item and a last item.
    By extrinsic, we mean that the first item is
    `first`, not because of what the item is,
    but because some external party put it there.

    Sequences aregeneralizations of stacks and queues,
    which support a subset of sequence operations.

In this sub-package we will implement some data structure that implement sequence interface
i.e.,
Array, LinkedList, Dynamic Array
